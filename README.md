# libft-42
First project of the 42 Lisbon Common Core. This project is designed to build foundational knowledge in C programming, focusing on:

Static libraries

Makefiles

Function implementation

You'll recreate a wide range of standard library functions — some directly inspired by the official man pages, others built almost entirely from scratch. The goal is to deepen your understanding of memory management, string manipulation, and low-level programming concepts.
